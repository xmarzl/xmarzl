08.2022:  
If I ever go back to a place where I think it's good and healthy to sit in front of a notebook, I'll be on my own.  
No education. No boss. I would try to create a community where everyone helps each other.  
But I rather think my next possible job will be something with music or with candles.  
Programming should be a hobby.  
Not something where my customer have to pay 120minutes of work for a windows installation which is done in under 30 minutes.

(I really hope this will be empty)
My future me:
