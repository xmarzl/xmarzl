08.2022:  
If I ever come back to a place, where I think that sitting in front of a notebook is good and healthy, I will be on my own. No education. No Boss. I would try to create a community where everyone helps the others. But I believe more, that my next possible job will be something with music or with candles. Programming should be a hobby.

(I really hope this will be empty)
My future me:
